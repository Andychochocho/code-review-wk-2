Description: I used the Bootstrap framework to help style my HTML page 
alongside my external stylesheet.  I also used Javascript and jQuery in 
order to make my "vacation" webpage be able to log the data from the user's
answers that were provided, then create three seperate scenario destination
that would be suited towards their needs.

Bugs: [Enter steps to reproduce below:]

-Can't seem to find out why my JS file won't seem to interact with my page when I click the submit button.
